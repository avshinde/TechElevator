SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with databases. It's used to store, retrieve, manage, and manipulate data in relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. \ud83e\uddf1 Basic SQL Concepts 1. Database A database is a container that holds tables. 2. Table A table is a collection of rows and columns. \ud83d\udcca Sample Table: Employees EmployeeID FirstName LastName Department Salary 1 John Doe HR 50000 2 Jane Smith IT 60000 3 Mike Johnson IT 55000 4 Lisa Wong Finance 70000 5 Tom Brown HR 52000 \ud83d\udd0d SELECT Queries Get all employees: SELECT * FROM Employees; Result: Returns all rows and columns from the table. Get only First and Last Names: SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees; Filter employees from IT department: SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Department = 'IT'; Employees with salary > 55000: SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 55000; \ud83d\udccb Other Basic Queries Sorting Data: SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY Salary DESC; Count of employees: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees; Group by Department: SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees FROM Employees GROUP BY Department; Average Salary by Department: SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary FROM Employees GROUP BY Department; \u270d\ufe0f Inserting Data INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary) VALUES (6, 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Marketing', 58000); \ud83d\udcdd Updating Data UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 62000 WHERE FirstName = 'Tom'; \u274c Deleting Data DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 6; \u2705 Tips SQL is case-insensitive . Always backup your data before DELETE or UPDATE . Use WHERE to avoid updating or deleting the whole table. \ud83e\udde0 Practice More Try to create your own table and run these queries: CREATE TABLE Students ( StudentID INT, Name VARCHAR(50), Grade INT ); INSERT INTO Students VALUES (1, 'Alice', 90), (2, 'Bob', 85); Then: SELECT * FROM Students;","title":"SQL"},{"location":"SQL/#sql-notes-for-beginners","text":"","title":"SQL Notes for Beginners"},{"location":"SQL/#what-is-sql","text":"SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with databases.
