|------------|-----------|----------|------------|--------|
| 1          | John      | Doe      | HR         | 50000  |
| 2          | Jane      | Smith    | IT         | 60000  |
| 3          | Mike      | Johnson  | IT         | 55000  |
| 4          | Lisa      | Wong     | Finance    | 70000  |

## üîç SELECT Queries

### Get all employees:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```
**Result:** Returns all rows and columns from the table.

### Get only First and Last Names:
```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;
```

### Filter employees from IT department:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT';
```

### Employees with salary > 55000:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 55000;
```

---

## üìã Other Basic Queries

### Sorting Data:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

### Count of employees:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;
```

### Group by Department:
```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```

### Average Salary by Department:
```sql
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Inserting Data
```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary)
VALUES (6, 'Emma', 'Stone', 'Marketing', 58000);
```

---

## üìù Updating Data
```sql
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 62000
WHERE FirstName = 'Tom';
```

---

## ‚ùå Deleting Data
```sql
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID = 6;
```

---

## ‚úÖ Tips
- SQL is **case-insensitive**.
- Always backup your data before `DELETE` or `UPDATE`.
- Use `WHERE` to avoid updating or deleting the whole table.

---

## üß† Practice More
Try to create your own table and run these queries:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
  StudentID INT,
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Grade INT
);

INSERT INTO Students VALUES (1, 'Alice', 90), (2, 'Bob', 85);
```

Then:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Students;
```
