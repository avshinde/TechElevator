- [CAP Theorem](./CAP_Theorem.md) – Trade-off between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
- [Consistent Hashing](./Consistent_Hashing.md) – Distributes load evenly in dynamic server environments.
- [Message Queues](./Message_Queues.md) – Decouples services using asynchronous event-driven architecture.
- [Rate Limiting](./Rate_Limiting.md) – Controls request frequency to prevent system overload.
- [API Gateway](./API_Gateway.md) – Centralized entry point for routing API requests.
- [Microservices](./Microservices.md) – Breaks systems into independent, loosely coupled services.
- [Service Discovery](./Service_Discovery.md) – Locates services dynamically in distributed systems.
- [CDN (Content Delivery Network)](./CDN.md) – Delivers content from edge servers for speed.
- [Database Indexing](./Database_Indexing.md) – Speeds up queries by indexing important fields.
- [Data Partitioning](./Data_Partitioning.md) – Divides data across nodes for scalability and performance.
- [Eventual Consistency](./Eventual_Consistency.md) – Guarantees consistency over time in distributed databases.
- [WebSockets](./WebSockets.md) – Enables bi-directional communication for live updates.
- [Scalability](./Scalability.md) – Increases capacity by upgrading or adding machines.
- [Fault Tolerance](./Fault_Tolerance.md) – Ensures system availability during hardware/software failures.
- [Monitoring](./Monitoring.md) – Tracks metrics and logs to understand system health.
- [Authentication & Authorization](./Auth.md) – Controls user access and verifies identity securely.
